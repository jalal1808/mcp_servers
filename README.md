# MCP Learnings

This directory contains my learning experiments, notes, and examples related to **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and its integration with AI agents.

The goal of this space is to understand how MCP can be used as a **knowledge base and tool interface** for intelligent agents, especially in multi-agent systems.

## 📌 What This Covers

- MCP fundamentals and concepts
- Using MCP as a knowledge source for agents
- Querying structured and unstructured data via MCP
- Integrating MCP with agent frameworks (e.g., Google ADK)
- Small experiments and proof-of-concepts
